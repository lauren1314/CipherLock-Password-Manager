# CipherLock-Password-Manager
This projects aims to allow users to be able to safely input and retrieve their different online account and passwords through the system once it has been registered and saved into the database. The system is created using Tkinter which is a GUI Library that allows me to add in widgets such as buttons, text boxes which users can interact with. The code also uses libraries such as secrets and strings to asssit me in generating values and letters (passcode generation).
